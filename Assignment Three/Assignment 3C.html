		<p>Planning Our Final Project <br>Nick Warren, Harp Mahli, James Garbagnati, Nicholae Christofferson <br>For the final project, we will be creating one or more custom shaders in Unity. We will take GLSL concepts from class, and learn how to recreate them using shaders in Unity.Our main goal is to recreate a hologram shader effect, similar to the pictures below:<br></p>

		<p><br> I think its created by applying a shader to a animated geometry, probably a phong shader plus a texture shader from what we've been shown so far. The texture changes from the camera's position since the camera is in 
		a first person view, you can see it update because you're charging your powers. However, the camera itself doesn't affect the textures, and when you enter certain area's that have low lighting, or a bright area, you see the brightness of the texture dim or brighten. <br> It's an effect that updates the pixels and texture of the shader because the texture changes throughout the game as you can charge up your power or when you upgrade it, and the lighting effects the hue of the powers as well.</p>
