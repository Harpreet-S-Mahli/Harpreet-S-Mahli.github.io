		<p>I choose the visual effects that the bioshock series in general apply to your characters powerup.<br>
		 I love it because it helps immerse the player deeper into the lore of the world. Since this game
		is about people genetically altering themselves to have powers, the visuals do a great job of showing how a persons
		body may change based on certian powerups.<br> I think its created by applying a shader to a animated geometry, probably a phong shader plus a texture shader from what we've been shown so far. The texture changes from the camera's position since the camera is in 
		a first person view, you can see it update because you're charging your powers. However, the camera itself doesn't affect the textures, and when you enter certain area's that have low lighting, or a bright area, you see the brightness of the texture dim or brighten. <br> It's an effect that updates the pixels and texture of the shader because the texture changes throughout the game as you can charge up your power or when you upgrade it, and the lighting effects the hue of the powers as well.</p>
