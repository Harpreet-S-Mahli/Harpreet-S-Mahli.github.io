		<p>We also want to try and make the shader as general and modular as possible, so parameters can be edited in Unity to create a desired effect.Based on our observations, we see that the shader used various patterns and stripes that animate over time. The patterns are could be using set values and distances, or simply a noise texture (depending on the style). There is also often a glow/bloom effect, which could be done in a similar way to the image processing assignment. Each pixel is essentially blurred around the outside of the mesh to create this effect. It also doesnâ€™t usually have any reactions to light.
